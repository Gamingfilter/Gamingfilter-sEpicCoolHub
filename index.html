      <p>Hello there! I'm passionate about gaming and sharing my experiences with others. I am Dutch, so you could also talk with me about Dutch things, but keep it in English, alright? Good. If I'm live, you could join me on my Twitch channel for exciting gameplay and engaging discussions. But yeah, I hope y'all have fun!</p>

        <h2>Why Did I Start My Internet "Career"?</h2>
        <p>Well, I started because I became aware that I love online interaction, and I don't really like it in person. I started because I wanted to socialize with people on the internet who share similar interests, which include games (big one is Nintendo games here), art, and probably even more that I can't think of right now. But yeah, if this speaks to you, be sure to join my community with the links on this webpage!</p>

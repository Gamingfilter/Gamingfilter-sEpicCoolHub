  <h2>Color models</h2>
  <p> Color models, also known as color spaces or color systems, are mathematical models and methods used to represent and describe colors in a way that can be understood and used by various applications that work with these models, which include graphic design, computer graphics, photography and printing. Different color models have different purposes and are used in different situations. To give you some view in this subject, I'll present 2 commonly used color models which you can find right down below</p>
<!--RGB and CMY(K)-->
  <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>RGB Color Model (Red, Green, Blue)</h2>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong><!--dikgedrukt--> RGB is used in digital displays, like monitors and screens, but also in digital image processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Colors are represented by mixing red, green, and blue light to visualize the thing/image you are representing. Each of these colors can be bright, but also dark. In computer terms, the values of brightness range from 0 to 255, resulting in a wide range of colors. For example, full intensity of all three colors creates white, while absence of all creates black.</li>
        </li>

        </div>

        <li> <!--Lijst-->
            <h2>CMY and CMYK Color Models (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black)</h2>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These are used in color printing.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> In CMY, colors are represented by removing various percentages of cyan, magenta, and yellow from white light. CMYK includes a fourth letter (K for Key or Black) which is used to enhance the color range and produce accurate blacks.</li>
        </li>
</ul> 
<p>Understanding and choosing the fitting color model for a given application is mandatory for achieving accurate and consistent color representation, as well as effective way to distribute color information. You've probably heard of resolution right? Well, for the chance you didn't know, it is basicly how much pixels you can actually see when using your computer or tv for example.

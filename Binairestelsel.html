         <h2>How the binary system works</h2>
          <p>The binary system is a numerical representation system that uses only two symbols: 0 and 1. It serves as the foundation for all modern digital computing and information storage. In the binary system, numbers are expressed as combinations of these two symbols, which correspond to the concept of "off" (0) and "on" (1) states in electronic circuits.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Base-2:</strong> The binary system is a base-2 numeral system, using two digits (0 and 1) to represent numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Place Value:</strong> Binary numbers use a place value system with increasing powers of 2.</li>
        <li><strong>Number Representation:</strong> Binary numbers are constructed by combining 0s and 1s in a sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic:</strong> Arithmetic operations in the binary system follow similar principles as in the decimal system.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Binary is widely used in computing because it aligns with the fundamental nature of digital electronics. In computers, everything is represented using binary, including numbers, characters, and instructions. Each binary digit, or bit, can be in one of two states, which corresponds directly to the electronic states of transistors (on/off) in computer hardware.</p>

    <p>Binary numbers are also used for various data encoding purposes, such as representing images, audio, and video, as well as in communication protocols and data storage systems. Understanding the binary system is essential for anyone working with digital technology and computer science.</p>

        <h2>Why Did I Start My Internet "Career"?</h2>
        <p>Well, I started because I became aware that I love online interaction, and I don't really like it in person. I started because I wanted to socialize with people on the internet who share similar interests, which include games (big one is Nintendo games here), art, and probably even more that I can't think of right now. But yeah, if this speaks to you, be sure to join my community with the links on this webpage!</p>

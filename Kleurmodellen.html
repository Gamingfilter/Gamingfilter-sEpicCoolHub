  <h2>Color models</h2>
  <p> Color models, also known as color spaces or color systems, are mathematical models and methods used to represent and describe colors in a way that can be understood and manipulated by various applications, including graphic design, computer graphics, photography, and printing. Different color models have different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here are 2 commonly used color models:</p>

  <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>RGB Color Model (Red, Green, Blue)</h2>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Used in digital displays like monitors and screens, as well as in digital image processing.</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Colors are represented by mixing various intensities of red, green, and blue light. Each component can have values from 0 to 255, resulting in a wide range of colors. For example, full intensity of all three components creates white, while absence of all creates black.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>CMY and CMYK Color Models (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black)</h2>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Used in color printing.</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In CMY, colors are represented by subtracting various percentages of cyan, magenta, and yellow from white light. CMYK includes a fourth component (K for Key or Black) to enhance the color range and produce accurate blacks.</p>
        </li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding and choosing the appropriate color model for a given application is essential for achieving accurate and consistent color representation, as well as effective communication of color information in various industries and creative fields.

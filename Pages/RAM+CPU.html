            <h2>RAM</h2>
            <p>RAM is an abreviation for Random Access Memory. RAM is the temporary memory of the computer. It consists of 1's and 0's, which represents on and off, that form data or other forms of memory. RAM has little pins on the bottom of it, so it is able to connect to the motherboard.</p>

            <h2>The connection between RAM and CPU</h2>
            <p>And that's where everything is connected. The motherboard connects the RAM and CPU (Central Processing Unit) with a bunch of wires. When the CPU needs something, it gets that data from the RAM. The RAM is able to instantly get that data and ship it to the CPU, but the CPU has more influence than only that. The CPU is able to also change data from the RAM, it's basicly updating the RAM to fit it's current state. For instance RAM could have the info that spotify is open, but when you decide to close the app, the CPU changes the RAM so that spotify is no longer open. And so it works with every little change that happens on your devices.</p>

            <h1>Introduction to the processor (or CPU, whatever you prefer)</h1>
            <p>Processors are a part of whatever device you're currently viewing this webpage. It is in phones, computers, laptops, even your nintendo 3ds that you have you have abandoned. In other words, processors are essential for an electronic device to function properly. So if they are so essential, what do they actually do?</p>

            <h1>Phases</h1>
            <p>Processors work in phases. There are in total 4.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Collection phase:</strong>Here it collects the code.</li>
                <li><strong>Decode phase:</strong>Here it takes that code, and translates it to an actual set of instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Execution phase:</strong>In this phase it executes the instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Saving phase:</strong>Finally, it saves it.</li>

            <h1>Binary code</h1>
            <p>The binary system is a big part of why the processor works. It gets the binary code, and translates it in actual instructions for the device to follow. If you want to know more about binary code just click the button in the container down below.</p>

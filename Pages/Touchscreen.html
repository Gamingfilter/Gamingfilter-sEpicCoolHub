        <h2>Touchscreens</h2>
        <p>Touchscreens are found in many places, in modernday phones, even at fast food restaurants like mac donalds. Yet not many people know how they work. So how does it work? How is it possible to interact with a device by just tapping the screen?</p>

      <h2>Two types of touchscreens</h2>
      <p>When it comes to touchscreens there are actually two types of touchscreens. For one you really need to press hard on the screen. These are called resistive touchscreen. How it works is that there are 2 sheets with only a small gap seperating them, when you press the screen the two sheets touch, which is recognised due to either a bunch of electrons on opposite sides of the sheets in a striped pattern (matrix configuration), or not in a pattern at all (analog configuration), while also having spacer dots on the bottom side. This is where the screens with resistive touchscreen mechanics notice that you pressed somewhere.</p>

      <p>The other type is capacitive touchscreens. These are the type that are found in most modernday phones. These work by the use of a finger and not when you have gloves on for instance. This is because it works on the conductive touch of the human finger. The screen itself is coated with a material that can store electrical charges. When you glide your finger over the screens there will be a change in electrical charge at the specific part you touched, the system picks up on that which allows your touch to correlate to a change on the screen. Stylusses also work on capacitive touchscreens. How is that on touch, it creates a small electrical current between the tip of the stylus</p>
